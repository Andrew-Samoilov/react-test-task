## Deploy to Netlify

https://darling-conkies-e0dbcb.netlify.app/

## Automatic CI/CD. 

You push to main - Netlify run build. There are no errors - your site is available.

> [!WARNING]
> In the Figma design:
> - `Contact form` in the title 2 times, is that necessary? (`Logo` and `Home` are also repeated, but this is not so critical)
> - `Desctop2` many duplicating rocket parameters. I can make whatever you need.
